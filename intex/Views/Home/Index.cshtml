    <h1 class="display-4">Things we need to do: </h1>

    <ol>
    <li> A landing page that explains to the user what the site is and what it does </li>
    <li>Clear navigation </li>
    <li>
        A page that lists out the summary data per accident for all accidents in the database.  (There are a significant number of records, so probably best to break the summary information up by pages.)
        The ability to filter the data in the summary page to get to specific result
    </li>
    <li>A page that allows administrators on the site to add/update/delete crash information</li>
    <li> Proper validation of the information being entered into the database</li>
    <li> At least one in-context usage of the word “Yeet” on the site</li>
    <li>
        All the finishing touches that make the difference, like changing the default icon for the site, using graphics/pictures/colors, changing the title for the tab on each page to be something relevant, using dropdowns where possible for entry, etc. that enhance the user experience on the site
        Good, clean, readable code (good commenting, indentation, line spacing, etc.)
    </li>
</ol>
</div>
